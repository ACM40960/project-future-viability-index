FVI SYSTEM KNOWLEDGE BASE
===========================
OVERVIEW: FUTURE VIABILITY INDEX (FVI) FRAMEWORK
===============================================
The Future Viability Index (FVI) is a comprehensive assessment framework for evaluating coal industry viability across multiple dimensions. The system evaluates countries based on seven core dimensions, each providing critical insights into the long-term sustainability and transition risks of coal-dependent economies.
The seven FVI dimensions are:
1. Infrastructure - Coal dependency and transition readiness
2. Necessity - Energy security and essential needs
3. Resource - Coal reserves and production capacity
4. Artificial Support - Government subsidies and policy support
5. Ecological - Environmental impact and sustainability
6. Economic - Market viability and financial risks
7. Emissions - Carbon footprint and climate compliance
DIMENSION 1: INFRASTRUCTURE

- Age and efficiency of coal-fired power plants
- Transmission grid dependency on coal baseload
- Industrial process dependence on coal-generated electricity
- District heating systems relying on coal
Countries with high coal dependency scores (above 60%) face significant stranding risks as the global energy transition accelerates. Examples include:
- India: 70% coal dependency in electricity
- China: 65% coal dependency despite renewable growth
- Poland: 75% coal dependency, highest in EU
- South Africa: 85% coal dependency, most vulnerable globally

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE OUTLOOK
=============================
The Future Viability Index provides a comprehensive framework for assessing coal industry sustainability across multiple dimensions. The analysis reveals that coal faces mounting challenges across all dimensions, with particularly severe risks in the ecological and emissions categories. While resource availability remains substantial and artificial support continues in many countries, the fundamental economics and environmental imperatives are driving a global energy transition away from coal.
Key findings:
1. Economic competitiveness: Coal is increasingly uncompetitive with renewables and natural gas in most markets
2. Environmental impact: Coal imposes severe health and environmental costs that are increasingly recognized and regulated
3. Climate incompatibility: Coal emissions are incompatible with global climate goals, requiring rapid phase-out
4. Stranded asset risks: Continued coal investment faces high risk of premature retirement and financial losses
5. Transition opportunities: Renewable energy and efficiency offer superior alternatives with declining costs
The transition timeline varies by country and region, with developed economies leading the phase-out and developing countries following with some delay. Success in managing the transition requires coordinated action across stakeholders, with particular attention to affected workers and communities to ensure a just and equitable transformation.
The FVI framework enables stakeholders to make informed decisions based on comprehensive assessment of coal industry viability, supporting evidence-based policy making, investment decisions, and transition planning. Regular updates to the index will track progress and emerging trends in the global energy transition.
