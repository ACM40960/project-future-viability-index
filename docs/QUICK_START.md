## 📈 System Overview

Your FVI system now includes:

```
📊 Data Coverage:
  ├── Infrastructure: 6 datasets (coal dependency, transition, cleanup, etc.)
  ├── Necessity: 6 datasets (energy security, jobs, industrial needs)  
  ├── Resource: 4 datasets (reserves, production, quality)
  ├── Artificial Support: 5 datasets (subsidies, tariffs, tax)
  ├── Ecological: 4 datasets (environmental impact, biodiversity)
  ├── Economic: 10 datasets (market viability, stranded assets)
  └── Emissions: 7 datasets (carbon footprint, climate targets)

🤖 AI Features:
  ├── Persona Detection (investor, policy_maker, ngo, analyst, citizen)
  ├── Document Search (RAG across guides and reports)
  ├── Context-Aware Responses
  └── Real-time Data Integration

📱 Interfaces:
  ├── Streamlit Web App (main interface)
  ├── FastAPI Backend (programmatic access)
  └── Command Line Tools (data validation, testing)
```

## 🎭 Personas Available

- **👔 Investor**: Financial focus (ROI, market risks, subsidies)
- **🏛️ Policy Maker**: Public interest (energy security, jobs, climate)
- **🌱 NGO**: Environmental/social (climate impact, communities)
- **📊 Analyst**: Balanced view (equal weight to all dimensions)
- **🏠 Citizen**: Local impact (energy costs, air quality, jobs)

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

**Problem**: Import errors
```bash
# Solution: Reinstall dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
```

**Problem**: No data loaded
```bash
# Solution: Validate data files
python validate_data.py
```

**Problem**: AI features not working
```bash
# Solution: Check API key
python -c "import os; print('API Key Set:', 'OPENAI_API_KEY' in os.environ)"
```

**Problem**: Performance issues
```bash
# Solution: Reduce workers in config.yaml
# Change: max_workers: 4 → max_workers: 2
```



1. **Run diagnostics**: `python validate_data.py`
2. **Check logs**: Look in `logs/` directory
3. **Test components**: `python setup_dependencies.py`
4. **Read full docs**: See `README.md`
